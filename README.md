The purpose of the program is to get an estimate regarding the length and width of buildings and to enable "investigation" of buildings in the real estate market.
How the program works after running it:
Pressing 1 - test option on a rectangle tower.\n
Pressing 2 - test option on a triangular tower./n
Clicking on 3 - Exit the program.
After pressing 1 or 2, the user must enter the height and width of the tower (the height of the tower must be at least 2).
For a rectangle, its perimeter will be printed if the difference of its sides is greater than 5, otherwise its area will be printed.
For a triangle, the user will select 1 to get the perimeter of the triangle, while to get a printout of the triangle, the user will press 2.
The triangle will be printed only if the width of the triangle is odd and its width is greater than twice its height - if the conditions are not met, no printing will be done.
